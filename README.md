# Hackathon2022

My project for the hackathon

there are 2 projects in here and i dont know how to work this so the files are mixed together sorry

this is made using unity engine so some of the code and variables are native to the engine and some of the variables are set within the editor which i cant link

The 2 projects are my original idea for this and then me realising i dont have enough to do it so i quickly bashed something together
i will upload an application for both(hopefully clearly labeled)
