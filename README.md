#My project for the hackathon


Windows.zip is the new project build

Hackathon 2022 oldBuild.zip (roughly) is the old project --> this is not finished its just so you can play through it
for the old build --> pick up the key cards with E and move with the WASD keys
you have to fix the temporal catastrophe by getting the scientist into the room

the engineer can fix broken things
the scientist can fix the time thing
the marine can fix open the security rooms

press e on the broken things to fix
press e on the black orbs to allow the character to escape

to select character when none are spawned press 1 for the scientist 2 for the marine and 3 for the engineer(i think)




The old project is my original idea(all of the scripts are mixed up sorry most of them cross over)
the new one was made when i realised i didnt have enough time to finish the old one os ive just put both on this
